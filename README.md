# Code for "A pervasive but asymmetric loss of global natural forests under multi-risk exposures"

This dataset provides the complete computational code, detailed descriptions, and key data outputs generated for the research article, "A pervasive but asymmetric loss of global natural forests under multi-risk exposures". This study quantifies the loss (both deforestation and degradation) of global natural forests between 2001 and 2020 and assesses its relationship with various risk exposures.

The dataset includes 12 Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts developed for the analysis. These scripts were used to integrate multi-source satellite data to identify natural forest extent, quantify deforestation and degradation areas, map the spatial distribution of risks such as drought, fire, and human activity, and estimate the associated Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) loss.

The output data generated by running these scripts is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17275663. The data are primarily in geospatial vector file format and contain aggregated statistics within global grid cells, such as forest loss area (in million hectares) and AGB loss (in Mg).
A comprehensive README file is provided, detailing the system requirements, step-by-step instructions for running the GEE scripts, and a description of the expected outputs to guide users.

# 1.	System Requirements
Software dependencies: The GEE platform with a valid user account. No local dependencies need to be installed.
Operating systems: Any OS that supports a modern web browser (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
Hardware: No special hardware is required; a standard desktop computer is sufficient.

# 2.	Installation Guide
Instructions: No installation is needed. Users can click on the GEE script links provided in the supplementary materials, and the scripts will load automatically in the GEE Code Editor.
Typical install time: Less than 10 minute.

# 3.	Demo
Instructions to run: After loading a script in the GEE Code Editor, click the "Run" button to execute the analysis. Some scripts may require the user to modify output paths or parameters according to comments within the code.
Expected output: The output of the scripts are chunked geospatial vector files or raster datasets containing statistics such as forest loss area (in million hectares) or AGB loss (in Mg), aggregated by grid cells.
Expected run time: On the GEE platform, the specific run time depends on the platform's current resource allocation, typically ranging from a few minutes to several tens of minutes.

# 4.	Instructions for use
Instructions: Each GEE script is designed for a specific analytical task, such as quantifying forest area changes, identifying deforestation and degradation, assessing exposure to different risks, and calculating the associated AGB loss . Users can modify the region of interest, time frame, or input data within the scripts to run similar analyses on their own data.
