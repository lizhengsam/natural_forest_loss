# Code for "A pervasive but asymmetric loss of global natural forests under multi-risk exposures"

This dataset provides the complete computational code, detailed descriptions, and key data outputs generated for the research article, "A pervasive but asymmetric loss of global natural forests under multi-risk exposures". This study quantifies the loss (both deforestation and degradation) of global natural forests between 2001 and 2020 and assesses its relationship with various risk exposures.

The dataset includes 12 Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts developed for the analysis. These scripts were used to integrate multi-source satellite data to identify natural forest extent, quantify deforestation and degradation areas, map the spatial distribution of risks such as drought, fire, and human activity, and estimate the associated Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) loss.

The output data generated by running these scripts are also included. The data are primarily in geospatial vector file format and contain aggregated statistics within global grid cells, such as forest loss area (in million hectares) and AGB loss (in Mg).
A comprehensive README file is provided, detailing the system requirements, step-by-step instructions for running the GEE scripts, and a description of the expected outputs to guide users.
